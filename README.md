I learn many basics of JS and also explore the jQuery which I find the unique library it makes easy things for to change or get , I like jQuery


JS constructor Property : tell that how the object is created , Function datatype is object
Types of Data in js :
1: Primitive or Value Datatypes  (number , string , boolean , undefined , null)
          It is copy based like a = 10 ; then b = a now a++; and console.log(a) = 11 but b value still is 10.
2: Refrence or Object Datatypes (Arrays , objects and functions)
          same address per point krta h copy nae hota 

NOTE: Primitives are copied by their value 
Refrence values are copied by their address


****** Here is the PRIMITIVE example for this :
****** Concept by Pass by Value
let a = 10;
function inc(a){
    a++;
    console.log(a)
}
inc(a)
console.log(a)


****** Here is the REFRENCE example for this :
****** Concept by Pass by Value
let number = {
    value : 10
}
function inc(a){
    a.value++;
   console.log(a.value)
}
inc(number);
console.log(number.value)
