**************************   Mini Project: To-Do List App



Problem Statement:

Create a simple To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app should allow users toAdd tasks to the list by entering text and clicking a button.
Display tasks dynamically on the webpage.
Delete tasks when a "Delete" button next to each task is clicked.
(Optional) Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them (strikethrough effect).




Requirements
Use an input field and a button to add tasks.
Use an unordered list (<ul>) to display tasks dynamically.
When a task is added, display it as a list item (<li>).
Each list item must have a Delete button that removes the task from the list.
(Optional): Add a feature to strike through tasks when clicked (marking as "completed").


Example
Here’s how it should work:

User enters a task: "Buy groceries" → Clicks Add Task → The task appears in the list.
The list shows:
Buy groceries [Delete]
If the user clicks Delete, the task disappears.
If the user clicks on the task itself (optional), it gets marked as "completed" (e.g., strikethrough).
